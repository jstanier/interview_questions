Questions for Graduate Java Devs


## How?
There's a folder in this repository for each of the questions below. They all have a skeleton of classes, and one called Runner. You need to fill in the code so that running the main method on Runner works correctly. Let me know if you have any problems; this is the first time we've tried this way of testing applicants so we might run into issues.

## What?
1. Factorial
2. Palindromes
3. Duplicates

## Where?
Please send your answers (as a compressed folder) to <robs@brandwatch.com>. Don't fork this repository or send in a pull request, since that would mean other applicants would be able to *cough* borrow *cough* your work.
