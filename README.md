Brandwatch Interview Questions: Graduates
=========================================

This is a take home test aimed at Computer Science graduates, or those applying for an internship.

## How?
There's a folder in this repository for each of the questions below. They all have a skeleton of classes, and one called Runner. You need to fill in the code so that running the main method on Runner works correctly. 

## What?
###1. Factorial
Calculate the factorial of an integer (e.g. factorial(3) = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6)
###2. Palindromes
Work out whether a string is a palindrome or not (e.g. palindrome("lol") = true)
###3. Duplicates
Take an array of integers and return all of the values that appear more than once (e.g. duplicates ([1,3,7,9,3,4,9]) = {3,9})

For each of these tasks, please provide documentation about your choice of algorithm. What is the big-O complexity of the code? What are the edge cases? This could be written in the comments or you could provide your own README file.

## Where?
Please send your answers (as a compressed folder) to the member of the recruitment team you are talking to. Don't fork this repository or send in a pull request, since that would mean other applicants would be able to *cough* borrow *cough* your work! From there, it will be forwarded to our engineers to review. What are they looking for?

* It should compile out of the box
* There should be clear documentation on how to run it
* The code style and formatting should be consistent and clear
* You get bonus points for making it build in Maven (or even Gradle if you're feeling fancy) and writing good unit tests

Good luck!
